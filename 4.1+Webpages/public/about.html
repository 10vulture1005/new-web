<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Dio Brando, later known simply as DIO, is the main antagonist of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise.</p>

<p>He is a megalomaniacal and sadistic vampire who is the sworn arch-enemy of the Joestar Family, becoming a burden to them even after his death, as well as being the arch-nemesis of Jonathan Joestar and Jotaro Kujo. DIO is hellbent on destroying them and the Joestar clan as a whole in his quest to conquer the world, as well as attaining godhood through reaching "Heaven" in his own image.</p>

<p>He fathered Giorno Giovanna and three other sons, the latter three being under the rule of his friend Enrico Pucci, whereas Giorno became the boss of Passione to stop the drug trade. In addition to being a powerful vampire in his own right, Dio wields the Stand known as The World, which grants him the ability to stop time itself.</p>
